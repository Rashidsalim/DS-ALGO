## Assignment 4

_Remove Duplicates from Sorted List (10 Marks)_

Given a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once.

**Example 1:**

Input: 1->1->2

Output: 1->2

**Example 2:**

[Test](Assignment4.java)

Input: 1->1->2->3->3

Output: 1->2->3

## Assignment 5

_Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array._
The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n respectively.
You may assume that nums1 has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2

**Example**

input:
nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3

nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3

Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
